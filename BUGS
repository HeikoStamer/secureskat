* there is still a problem with a crazy loop (num==0) consuming CPU cycles:
read_after_select() started [what=2,readed=0]
read_after_select() ended [what=2,readed=0,del_pipe.size()=0]
read_after_select() started [what=1,readed=0]
read_after_select() ended [what=1,readed=0,del_pipe.size()=0]
* most versions of SecureSkat are not compatible to each other
* due to increased key length there can be an issue with the limited
  length (512 chars) of IRC messages enforced by some IRC servers
* long onion addresses (63 chars) may fail due to limited length (64 chars) of
  'real name' field in the initial IRC USER-message (37 out of 64 chars are
  already used for other client information) enforced by some IRC servers
* procedure 'waiting for three players' is rarely unstable
