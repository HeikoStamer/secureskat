* obtain full conformance with RFC2812 [MAX_NICKLEN=9, MAX_CHANNELLEN=50/30]
  max. 15 irc parameters, irc msg. length. max 512 byte,
  msg. seperator CR+LF, nickname starts with letter or special char.
  channelname only letters and digits, numeric replies
+ use AIO for secure communication channels between players (replaces
  securesocketstream.hh)

- provide nice libpopt/getopt commandline interface

Further open tasks to do:
- [fair ranking system (command /rank)]

   Timothy Furtak, Nathan Sturtevant: Improving State Evaluation, Inference,
   and Search in Trick-Based Card Games. IJCAI 2009, pp. 1407--1413]
