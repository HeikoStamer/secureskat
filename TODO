Stuff that should be done (until first production release):

+ use GNU TLS for privacy and integrity protection
+ replace (former) xskat GUI by native IRC server implementation
+ tunnel TCP connections via IRC (if requested, e.g. paranoid firewall)
- for gcc: perror output with __FILE__::__FUNCTION__
- do more internationalization support (in particular SecureSkat_vtmf.cc)
- fix race conditions in parts of the voting system (or remove it completely)
- fix race conditions in automatic player/table handshake
- configuration and key databases in directory ~/.SecureSkat
- add commands for manual key exchange (export/import)
- provide nice libpopt commandline interface
- use GcrySexp for ADTs/ store secrets via subkey in OpenPGP-impl.
+ documentation: doc subdir, manpage, texinfo, paper

Further open tasks:

- [fair ranking system (command /rank)]
- [artificial intelligence (SecureSkat_ai)]

Any volunteers?
