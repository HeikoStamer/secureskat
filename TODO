Stuff for next release:
* use SetupGenerators() in VSSHE to protect agains malicious provers

Stuff for 3.x release:
* obtain full conformance with RFC2812 [MAX_NICKLEN=9, MAX_CHANNELLEN=50/30]
  max. 15 irc parameters, irc msg. length. max 512 byte,
  msg. seperator CR+LF, nickname starts with letter or special char.
  channelname only letters and digits, numeric replies
+ use AIO for secure communication channels between players (replaces
  securesocketstream.hh)
+ use RBC for broadcast on additional communication channels
+ add GNUnet integration as configure feature

Minor stuff that should be done eventually:
+ documentation: manpage and/or texinfo manual (doc subdir)
+ replace the former xskat GUI by a native implementation (GnomeSkat)
+ tunnel peer2peer TCP connections via IRC, if requested (paranoid firewall)
- for gcc: perror output with __FILE__::__FUNCTION__
- fix race conditions in parts of the voting system (or remove it completely)
- fix race conditions in automatic player/table handshake
- provide nice libpopt/getopt commandline interface
- use GcrySexp for ADTs/ store secrets via subkey in OpenPGP-impl.

Further open tasks to do:
- [fair ranking system (command /rank)]
- [artificial intelligence (SecureSkat_ai)]

Any volunteers?
