SecureSkat 2.8:
    - added a message delay to avoid kick off (e.g. irc.freenode.net)
    - removed obsolete stuff (ABHEBEN, COMMON_DDH_GROUP, old PBKDF)
    - increased iteration count of PBKDF1 to 7000 (key file encryption)
    - key identifier has now only 5 characters (RFC: nick length 9 char)
    -		
SecureSkat 2.7:
    - now we're using Groth's protocol for the verifiable secret shuffle
      (improves the performance and communication complexity significantly)
    - Null-games are now aborted immediately, if lost by the playing party
    - added an alternative table announcement (PRIVMSG to channel), because
      some IRC servers (e.g. freenode.net) are blocking PRIVMSG to users
    - the command /players now additionally shows the key fingerprints
SecureSkat 2.6:
    - bugfixes and some German translations (internationalization support)
    - secret key protection: use the PBKDF1 from RFC 2898 (salt and it.-count)
    - user commands for manually public key export and import (file)
    - directory ~/.SecureSkat is now used for the key and ranking databases
    - changed the COMMON_DDH_GROUP to the well-known MODP group 2 of RFC 2412
    - command /players now additionally shows the package name and version
SecureSkat 2.5:
    - a bug in the generation of the ranking data was fixed
    - important bugfixes for the secret voting functions
    - protecting the secret key: encryption with user-supplied pass phrase
    - a bug in the control program "SecureSkat_random" was fixed
      (it occured only, if the player has used a nickname with spaces)
    - rudimentary internationalization support (GNU gettext) added
SecureSkat 2.4:
    - LibTMCG is now separated from the SecureSkat package
      (see http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/libtmcg/)
    - URGENT security fix: our implementation of a proof of knowledge
      (equality of discrete logarithms) was not sound, i.e. the missing
      instantiation of mpz_shash on the verifier side permits cheating.
      These problems are issues of the library LibTMCG. We announce them
      here to reach all affected users of LibTMCG resp. SecureSkat.
SecureSkat 2.3:
    - initial GNU/Savannah release (former name openSkat, included LibTMCG)
