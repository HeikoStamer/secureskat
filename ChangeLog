SecureSkat 2.3:
		- initial GNU/Savannah release (no new features, but included libTMCG)
SecureSkat 2.4:
		- libTMCG is now separated from this package
		  (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/libtmcg/)
		- URGENT security fix: our implementation of a proof of knowledge
		  (equality of discrete logarithms) was not sound, i.e. the missing
		  instantiation of mpz_shash on the verifier side permits cheating.
		  These problems are issues of the library libTMCG. We announce them
		  here to reach all possible users of SecureSkat.
SecureSkat 2.5:
