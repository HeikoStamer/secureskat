SecureSkat 2.3:
		- initial GNU/Savannah release (no new features, but included libTMCG)
SecureSkat 2.4:
		- libTMCG is now separated from the SecureSkat package
		  (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/libtmcg/)
		- URGENT security fix: our implementation of a proof of knowledge
		  (equality of discrete logarithms) was not sound, i.e. the missing
		  instantiation of mpz_shash on the verifier side permits cheating.
		  These problems are issues of the library libTMCG. We announce them
		  here to reach all possible users of libTMCG/SecureSkat.
SecureSkat 2.5:
		- a bug in the generation of the ranking data was fixed
		- important bugfixes for the secret voting facility
		- protecting the secret key: encryption with user-supplied pass phrase
		- a bug in the control program "SecureSkat_random" was fixed
		  (it occured only, if one uses a nickname with spaces)
		- rudimentary internationalization support (GNU gettext) added
SecureSkat 2.6:
		- bugfixes and some German translations (internationalization support)
		- secret key protection: use the PBKDF1 from RFC 2898 (salt and it.-count)
		- user commands for manually public key export and import (file)
		- directory ~/.SecureSkat is now used for the key and ranking databases
		- changed the COMMON_DDH_GROUP to the Well-Known MODP Group 2 of RFC 2412
		- command /players shows now the package name and version
SecureSkat 2.7:
